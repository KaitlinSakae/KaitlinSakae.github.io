					<h1> About</h1>
				
					<p>   Plant Town was first established in 2018 by Kaitlin Sakae, a design and plant obsessed human. Sakae's dream was to build a plant community that was affordable to all and all inclusive. Within the past few years, plant ownership has become a niche practice, so Sakae hopes to make the plant industry back to its roots and make plants earthy again! </p>
