                                <p>
                                   Bouldering is the purest form of rock climbing. And the most accessible. You’re not burdened with ropes, harnesses, or quickdraws. Routes are short, intense, and powerful. And all you need is a pair of shoes and a chalk bag (a working understanding of key climbing lingo helps, too).

                                    But bouldering at your limit means no room for error. Each foot placement, toe smear, and heel hook must be perfectly placed.

                                <p>
                                    Shawn Raboutou’s “Roadkill” (V15/8C) is a big boulder problem with big moves. Sparse but distinct features create just enough for a desperate line and a nauseatingly tall climb.

                                    Watch Dave Graham and Clem Lechaptois try to tame the beast, Mellow-style. Expect EDM, gymnastic climbing sequences, and attempt after attempt by two mega-strong climbers pushed to the limit of their abilities.
